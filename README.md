# ETL_Pipeline
This is a ETL Pipeline

I Built an ETL (Extract/Transform/Load) pipeline to process sales data from multiple countries using Kaggle .csv files. </br>
Used Python Flask for ingestion, Pandas for data manipulation, and NumPy for calculations. </br>
Stored data in Google Cloud Storage, automated uploads to BigQuery using Google Cloud Functions, and visualized data with Looker</br>
</br>
This is a Chart in Looker that displays sales data from GCP BigQuery:</br>
